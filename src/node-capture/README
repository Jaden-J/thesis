This directory contains an elementary example showing how easy it is to get data
from the memory of a running AVR MCU.

Pre-requisites: avarice, gdb, avr-gdb, hexdump, diff

Steps to perform:

1. setup a AVR MCU with the JTAG connector wired.
   (optionally connect the MCU via a MAX232 and a serial cable to a terminal)
   NOTE: the code is configured for using USART1 (not USART0)
2. connect (preferably) a JTAGICE mkII to the JTAG wiring
3. issue "make program" (with default parameters MCU=atmega1284p F_CPU=8000000)
4. issue ./perform-attack.sh

   $ ./perform-attack.sh 
   *** starting avarice...
   *** performing memory dump using gdb...
   *** waiting for second iteration...
   *** starting avarice...
   *** performing memory dump using gdb...
   *** difference between dumps...
