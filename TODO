TODO

1. complete manual reputation module implementation
2. finish code generation

  - prefix function_names and properties with module_name (trust and trust!!)
  - integrate
    - add generated/generic? Makefile
  - case ELSE

  Small TODOs:

  - include "constants.h" (needed: at end include everywhere)
  - include tuples.h (needed: at end include everywhere)
  - moose -> init on canvas (#includes)
    -> @ end .find().append()
  - include time for time_t

  ISSUES / LIMITATIONS

  - inference of e.g. time, sequence, ... in .contains([#atom, ...])
    is incorrectly byte => due to earlier idea of payload = byte**
    -> can be used, but with e.g. limited time information
  - check typing of matchers -> should be timestamp, but is integer ?!

3. solder motes
4. clean up coordinate.py
5. get metrics
  - xbee: 1) #frames
          2) bytes sent/received
  - mcu:  3) time IDS code
          4) code size (LoC + hex bytes)
  scope:
    1) no IDS
    2) IDS HB
    3)     reputation
    4)     HB + reputation
6. write thesis (+ add metrics to IEEE-style article)

  - add section on development of embedded systems
    - compilation/deployment style:
      - hex + install
      - OS process + deployment OTAP
    - target platform definition

*** at end
- make sure illustrations use same font-sizes, colors, ...
- node-capture: replace ISP programming with JTAG programming
